      <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Matthew Neuber. I am a business intelligence manager by day, but I am also
          a Philadelphia sports fan, traveler, photographer, proud uncle, and maybe most importantly... an aspiring web
          developer! I am intersted in learning more about technology and how it is utilzed in businesses and startups.
          I am always looking to continue my education, and I am currently enrolled in UPenn's Coding Bootcamp in order
          to learn full stack web development and computer science.</p>

      <p>I've created this profile and portfolio page in order to keep track of all of the interesting projects, web apps
          and programs that I am building. Visit my portfolio page for a tour of them. Also visit the contact page to reach
          out for more information.</p>

      <p>Please check back periodically for updates to this website. I'll be posting more as I continue my journey over the
          next 6 months.</p>
